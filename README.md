#VAGRANT TASK
My journey so far with **ALX** has been an amazing. I have learnt a lot, so far I have been doing my projects withe the provided sandbox but today I learnt how to install and use tools to help me virtualize my system. The journey hasbeen so educative and inspiring. Some of the things I have learnt include:
*Shell basics
*The use of Git and Github
*Different editors(Vim, emacs)
*The use of psuedocodes, flowcharts and algorithms
*Vagrant
*Virtual Box
*Docker
